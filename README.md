Hi there 👋 I'm a dual-citizen and trilingual software engineer from La Havana, Cuba. 

-🔭 I’m currently working on a web application that helps individuals and organizations track their carbon footprint and provides personalized recommendations for reducing their environmental impact. I'm also contributing to open-source projects related to sustainability and climate action.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about machine learning and data analytics, with a focus on applying these tools to environmental data. I'm also studying UX design and front-end development to improve the user experience of my applications.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate in projects related to renewable energy, circular economy, and sustainable agriculture.
- 🤔 I'm always looking for opportunities to learn and grow as a developer. 
- 💬 You can ask me about my experiences working at the intersection of technology and sustainability, my favorite coding languages and tools, or my thoughts on the role of software engineers in addressing environmental challenges.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a yoga instructor and a textile artist. Weaving and creating textiles is one of my biggest passions, and I have my own design studio where I spend a lot of my free time. Lately, due to Covid-19 though, my dad and I have been collaborating on some really cool DIY projects. One of our recent projects was building a air quality filtration system to improve the indoor air quality using computer fans.
